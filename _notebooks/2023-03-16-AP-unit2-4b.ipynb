    "    - *The database schema is the structure of a database described in a language supported by the database management system. The term schema refers to the organization of data as of how the database is constructed.*\n",
    "- What is the purpose of identity Column in SQL database?\n",
    "    - *The Identity columns can be used for generating key values. The identity property on a column guarantees the following: Each new value is generated based on the current seed value increment. Each new value for a particular transaction is different from other concurrent transactions on the table.*\n",
    "- What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database?\n",
    "    - *A primary key is the column or columns that contain values that uniquely identify each row in a table. A primary key is needed: To extract or archive data from a table that is visited more than once during a process*\n",
    "- What are the Data Types in SQL table?\n",
    "    - *Data types are hte diffrent types the data stored can be represented. For example, Numeric data types such as: INT , TINYINT , BIGINT , FLOAT , REAL , etc. Date and Time data types such as: DATE , TIME , DATETIME , etc. Character and String data types such as: CHAR , VARCHAR, TEXT*"
