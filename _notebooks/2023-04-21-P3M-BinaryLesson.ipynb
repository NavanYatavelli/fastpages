    "\n",
    "#### Basic Information\n",
    "* Bit is short for __binary____ digit, and represents a value of either 0 or 1.\n",
    "    - A byte is 8 bits.\n",
    "* Sequences of bits are used to represent different things.\n",
    "    - Representing data with sequences of bits is called _____abstraction______.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practice Questions:\n",
    "1. How many bits are in 3 bytes?: 24 bits\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What digital information can be represented by bits?: booleans\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Are bits an analog or digital form of storing data? What is the difference between the two?: Digital form of storing data, analog is physical, digital is virtual or digital.\n",

    "#### Examples\n",
    "* Boolean variables (true or false) are the easiest way to visualize binary.\n",
    "    - 0 = False\n",
