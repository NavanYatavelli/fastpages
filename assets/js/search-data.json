Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0 | The 14-second video led me to believe that the program displayed the input (the command that was being executed) and the computer&#39;s output, which was a table of values for each triangle side. Additionally, the functionality of the software was discussed in the write-up. The response did not &quot;specify the program&#39;s goal,&quot; according to the College Board&#39;s justification for giving this submission a 0 in this category. This response received a 0, as CB will issue a 0 if even one component of the criteria is lacking. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | There were 2 program code segments; in the writeup, the name of the variable that represented the list was utilized, and the submission discussed the information in the sides list and its function in the overall program. It discusses how without the list and its information, the program would not have operated. The College Board approved of this grade. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The submission&#39;s paper omitted any discussion of the named list&#39;s (sideIndex) role in the program&#39;s complexity management. CB awarded the proposal a 0/1 for this score category and agreed with this assessment. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student-developed procedure is ratioCalculate, and there&#39;s one student-developed procedure and another code segment where that procedure is being called. In the writeup, the submission also talks about how that ratioCalculate procedure contributes to the functionality of the program. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | In the writeup, there is a program code segment which talks about the student-developed algorithm ratioCalculate, which includes all of the CB requirements. The writeup is very descriptive in regards to this algorithm, which is why CB also gave the submission a 1/1 in this category. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | This deserved a 1/1, since the writeup showed two calls to the procedure with different arguments, and the conditions which were tested for each of those calls were described. Finally, the response showed the results for each of those calls, and therefore, meeting all the requirements for this scoring section, CB also gave it a 1/1. | . . Submission #2 . Reporting Category | Student Score | CB Score | Comments | . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | In the video demonstrating the software in action, it can be seen that there is user input from the player placing the tiles on the grid and output from the game&#39;s operation. The simulation is then demonstrated in action. The submission&#39;s writeup discusses the goal of the program, the functionality seen in the video, and the input/output of the program (explicitly written in writeup). This assessment was supported by CB, who also rated them a 1/1. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The post includes two distinct code portions that demonstrate how data is maintained. It provides the list&#39;s name (startGrid) and a description of its contents. It satisfies all conditions, and both CB&#39;s and I rated it a 1/1. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | In the writeup (3.b.v), the submission talks about how doing the task with variables or another method would be incredibly complex, and then talks about how they used a list to manage that complexity. This is why I gave it a 1/1, and CB did as well. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The replaceList procedure is talked about in the writeup, and in the writeup, it also talks about how the procedure contributes to the functionality of the program and its necessity. Therefore, it deserved a 1/1 and CB agreed. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The submission talks about the replaceList procedure and the algorithmic implementation within it. The writeup is very specific in regards to the algorithm and the procedure that its located in, meeting all the requirements, so it deserved a 1/1. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | CB concurred that the tests earned a 1/1. The two calls to the procedure that help the program&#39;s various code segments run are discussed in the write-up. The write-up also discusses the procedure call circumstances that are being examined, followed by the outcomes of the two procedure calls. | .",

Reflection (Vocab ) . A simulation is an simpler abstraction of an very complicated natural phenomena. Simulations help for people to learn more and predict important data which they can use to better improve algorithms and products. Simulations are often much cheaper and have no safety limits compared to real life experiments. I found these problems to be a little challenging, but a good review of simulations. Simulations are needed for modeling complicated situations in a much simpler way so that any user can still manage most aspects of the model without delving into complexities. .

Here is a simulation of a pandas birth, which accurately simulates how many male or female pandas would be born if there were 1000 births. Using a simulation is much more efficient, better and replicates the real world situation. The simulation here also caluclates the percentage of male vs female born.

This lesson emphasized ways that which code can be efficiently and effectively written through use of libraries, documentation, and APIs. Libraries consist of pre-written code that can be utilizing in other programs. They help to simplify code by storing code segments and features in a separate place, this way, the code being run only has code that the user has written. A library’s documentation describes the different features of a library. Libraries are collections of code and scripts that can provide faster solvents to problems. . Problem 2: Multiple Choice .

A. x = start, y = stop, z = step | B. x = start, y = step, z = stop | C. x = stop, y = start, z = step | D. x = step, y = start, z = stop | . (3) Which of the following is NOT part of the random library? . A. random.item | B. random.random | C. random.shuffle | D. random.randint | . Problem 3: Short Answer Questions . (1) What is the advantage of using libraries? . Libraries have a distinct advantage of having pre-written code that can provide efficiency at a linear level. Libraries help to simplify complex programs by allowing the code to reference pre-written code. This reduces the workload for the user writing the code and improves reliability. This cuts out time that the user has to write repetitive code. The user can spend more time on the creative and work process then repetitive code writing. . (2) Write a thorough documentation of the following code. . import random # Saves user input in the in the comma seperated format names_string = input(&quot;Give me everybody&#39;s names, seperated by a comma.&quot;) # splits the stored user input by the character, comma, and stores each element in the list names names = names_string.split(&quot;,&quot;) # get the length of names num_items = len(names) # get random number within &lt; num_items random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items - 1) # figuring out randomly who to play person_who_will_pay = names[random_choice] # Prints the name random person name with message print(f&quot;{person_who_will_pay} is going to buy the meal today!&quot;) . Output . Brady is going to buy the meal today! . Problem 4: Coding Challenges! . (1) Create a program to pick five random names from a list of at least 15 names . import random # list of random names random_names = [&quot;Aaron Rodgers&quot;,&quot;Rob Gronkowski&quot;, &quot;Patrick Mahomes&quot;, &quot;Odell Beckham &quot;, &quot;Ben Roethlisberger&quot;, &quot;Russell Wilson&quot;, &quot;Cam Newton&quot;, &quot;Lamar Jackson&quot;, &quot;Antonio Brown&quot;, &quot;JJ Watt&quot;, &quot;Adrian Peterson&quot;, &quot;Keira&quot;, &quot;Deshaun Watson&quot;, &quot; Lionel Messi&quot;, &quot;Jerry Rice&quot;] i = 0 # printing 5 random names print(&quot;The five random names are:&quot;) while i &lt; 5: print(random.choice(random_names)) i += 1 . Output . Lamar Jackson Ben Roethlisberger Russell Wilson Adrian Peterson Deshaun Watson . (2) Create a program to simulate a dice game where each player rolls two fair dice (6 sides); the player with the greater sum wins . import random def playerA(): firstRoll = 0 firstRoll = random.randrange(1,6) secondRoll = 0 secondRoll = random.randrange(1,6) score = firstRoll + secondRoll return score def playerB(): firstRoll = 0 firstRoll = random.randrange(1,6) secondRoll = 0 secondRoll = random.randrange(1,6) score = firstRoll + secondRoll return score first = playerA() print(&quot;First Player rolled&quot;,first) second = playerB() print(&quot;Second Player rolled&quot;,second) if (first &gt; second): print(&quot;First Player won!&quot;) else: print(&quot;Second Player won!&quot;) . Output . First Player rolled 3 Second Player rolled 8 Second Player won! . EXTRA-CREDIT OPPORTUNITY: Create a program to randomly generate one of those 5x5 square CollegeBoard robot courses frequently seen in these lessons . EXTRA X 2: Put safeguards in your program to make sure the robot course is actually possible to complete. . import random # This &gt; is Start # This O is End # These # are obstacles print(&quot;Generating 3 randomized 5x5 squares:&quot;) count = 0 directions = [&quot;up&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;] while count &lt; 3: grid = [[&#39;_&#39; for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(5)] direction = random.choice(directions) obstacles = 12 for i in range(obstacles): row = random.randint(0, 4) col = random.randint(0, 4) grid[row][col] = &#39;#&#39; finish_row = random.randint(0, 4) finish_column = random.randint(0, 4) grid[finish_row][finish_column] = &#39;O&#39; start_row = random.randint(0, 4) start_column = random.randint(0, 4) grid[start_row][start_column] = &#39;&gt;&#39; print(&quot;Initial Direction: &quot; + direction) for row in grid: print(&#39; &#39;.join(row)) print(&quot;==========&quot;) count = count + 1 .

Notes Taken During the Presentation . It is important for girls to be in engineering and computer science because these fields are crucial for shaping the future of technology and innovation. Girls bring a unique perspective and set of experiences to the table, which can help lead to the development of new ideas and solutions to problems. Furthermore, having more diversity in these fields can help break down stereotypes and biases, leading to a more inclusive and equitable industry. . It is important to keep trying even when you fail in engineering and computer science. These fields can be challenging, and it is natural to face obstacles and setbacks. However, it is important to persevere and not let failure discourage you. Instead, use failure as an opportunity to learn and grow, and to develop new strategies and approaches. With determination and hard work, you can overcome any challenge and achieve your goals in engineering and computer science. .",

Question 3 HACK . { if MOVE_FORWARD_ALLOWED{ moveForwards } else{ if TURN_RIGHT_ALLOWED{ turnright } if TURN_LEFT_ALLOWED{ turnleft } } } . Question 4 &amp; 5 . . Explanation: We would start our search for element 69 by looking at the middle index, 5 first (8 elements divide by 2, plus 1 index). We find 6. 6 being less than 69 would lead you to consider the greater than half. The middle index for this section is Seven (5+9 = 14/2 = 7). Index number seven is 11, which is lower than index number 69. The eighth index is next examined ((8+8)/2 = 8). We searched and discovered the right number because 8 = 69. . Question 6 Diagram . . Question 7 . Shown as below in alphabetical order, ascending, place these in this order. As numbers are greater, you can compare which numerical value of these ascii characters is greater, allowing these to be correctly compared. . [&quot;Market”, ”Ralphs”, “store”, &quot;Target”, ”Walmart”] . Question 8 HACK . The binary search automatically rules out half of the options with each iteration, it is much faster than sequential search. Since you begin at the middle index, you can either select the group that is higher or lower than the middle index. As a result, each time you divide, you will eliminate half of the potential outcomes. . Question 9 HACK . From the list [64,36,16,11,9], we should be looking for number 36. First, I would choose the middle element ((1+5)/2 = 3), and since 16 is less than 36, I would shift back (as the list is reversed). As a result, I would choose the second element (1+3/2 = 2), which equals 36, therefore it would take me just two tries to reach 36. .",

Rather, it returns a new list with the values at indices j and k interchanged. Video Notes: Topic is Program Design and Development How is a program developed? Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan Sometimes the development is more exploratory than anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens Investigation is an important step in the process Developers must: Determine the requirements of the program Understand the constraints Understand the user concerns and interests How do developers investigate Surveys User testing Interviews Direct observation Developers design program by Brainstorming Storyboarding the program Planning the user experience Laying out the user interface Organizing into modules . 28: This code segment incorrectly charges customers who use more than 25 units of electricity. These customers are charged $7 per unit for all units, when they should be charged this rate only for the number of units above 25. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 – 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174. This code segment would incorrectly charge the customer $224 for the 32 units. Video Notes Topic: Conditionals Algorithm: a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task Selection: Given a parameter the algorithm uses its instructions to determine if it needs to return true or false. EX: If statements Evaluates a conditional and return true or false statement . 30: Introducing a list to a program makes it more likely that the program will attempt to access an index beyond the length of the list, not less likely. Video Notes: Topic is Data Abstraction Strings An ordered sequence of characters May contain letters, numbers and all other special characters Ex: Words, phrases, sentences, ID numbers, etc. Lists An ordered sequence of elements Each element is a variable Ex: Playlists of songs, Names of students in a school, contacts in your phone, etc List Index Each element of a string is referenced by an index The index starts at 1 . Essential Information A list is an ordered sequence of elements An element is an individual value in a list that is assigned a unique index An index is a common method for referencing the elements in a list or string using natural numbers A string is an ordered sequence of characters . 45: The if condition (value &gt; 0) in the for loop where count1 is updated for theList values 1,2. So the count-1 =2. The else condition of (value &gt; 0) in the for loop where count2 is updated for theList values -2,-1,0. So the count-2 =3. . Notes of all the questions answered below . Result is equal to 2 which is multiplied by 5,when the procedure is ran 3 times which displays the resulting value | When the variable x is positive or 0, then Y will become False, so when it is put into the IF statement, the process will not go through because it is relayed as false instead of true | All of the other answers are all benefits that would not harm the team | The first two reasons, location as well as the dietary restrictions are both needed.

Past restaurants are also not needed to be known in order to find new restaurants in the area. | The variable will keep getting 2 added to it until the variable is greater than the MAX variable. The first variable keeps on going even when it is equal to or less than the MAX variable. | The denominator must not be 0 ever, if the denominator is zero then the equation becomes impossible to calculate. The equation becomes undefined. | Newlist is making a copy of the numlist and interchanging the elements at J and K. Counting is also started at 1 instead of zero and the command LENGTH(numlist) counts all of the numbers that are available inside of the list, when counting these numbers it creates an end value which when placed back in the code cannot be passed. | Score- penalty must be 0 or positive and the current commands and code do not satisfy the command and will cause it to fail. So line 7 must be changed with line 3. | doing the work independently is not good for collaboration and can cause bigger failures and blocks in code writing | The outer loop iterates from j = 1 to myList length-1. Assigns k = j+1. The inner loop iterates from k=j+1 to myList length. If condition compares j’th and k’th values of myList. The code segment iterates through myList, comparing each element to all subsequent elements in the list and makes containsDuplicates = true if equal. | The user should not be made to put in the cost of the product, if that were true then they can pay whatever price they had wanted for the food. | If the contents of myList contained [-1, 0, 1] then the procedure will not return the intended result. This is because when the code is running, it will look at the first value and return false. However, it will keep on returning the next two values as true and in the end will ultimately return true even though a negative value is present. | 8 is greater than 7 so it will get passed in the first if statement, to correct this part of the code the first if statement should be replaced with &gt;8. The second problem is that 6 is less than 7 so it goes to the else statement which makes it display a check which is wrong. | The users should not be able to do much relating with the code, they can however provide different perspectives to the developers that provide new problems/ challenges which need to be overcome. | When answering this question I was stuck on answer one and answer two, I had known that the messages were needed to be sent in packets so the other two answers could not be correct, however I was not sure whether or not | Open protocols on the Internet helps – a way to standardize data transmission between different devices | Relationship between the World Wide Web and the Internet – WWW can be considered as linked pages, programs, and files.

Also for &gt;25 is correct in C. | List can grow at runtime. We can add, modify or delete elements as needed | The benefit of using a list as a data abstraction in this logic is – keeping the numeric values in a list makes it easier to apply the same computation to every data element. | In this myWord the element at index 3 of wordList is “ghi”. myChar the character at index 2 of myWord is “h” | myList is copied to yourList | Values greater than equal to 90 are printed | Copied in this sequence [“guitar”, “drums”, “bass”] → firstList → thirdList → secondList | The logic time &gt; 120 makes maxPS = 30 otherwise maxPS =50 is selected | Appending 2*i where i ranges from 1 to 10 – would store ten consecutive even integers, beginning with 2, in the list evenList. | To swap the values in two variables num1 → temp and num2 → num1 and finally temp → num2 | Word2 is not changed.

Challenge . This code segment is at a very early stage of implementation. . What are some ways to (user) error proof this code? | The code should be able to calculate the cost of the meal of the user | . Hint: . write a “single” test describing an expectation of the program of the program | test - input burger, expect output of burger price | run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature | write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass | . Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99} total = 0 #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;Menu&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): # CHANGED: &#39; &#39; to &#39; t&#39; print(k + &quot; t$&quot; + str(v)) #ideally the code should prompt the user multiple times items = input(&quot;Please select item(s) from the menu (comma-separated): &quot;) items_standarized = [item.strip() for item in items.split(&quot;,&quot;)] for item in items_standarized: if item not in menu.keys(): print(f&quot;Error: unrecognized menu item: {item}&quot;) exit() total += menu[item] print(&quot;Your total is: $&quot; + str(round(total, 2))) . Menu burger $3.99 fries $1.99 drink $0.99 Your total is: $4.98 . Hacks . Now is a good time to think about Testing of your teams final project... . What errors may arise in your project? | What are some test cases that can be used? | Make sure to document any bugs you encounter and how you solved the problem. | What are “single” tests that you will perform on your project? Or, your part of the project? As Hack Design and Test plan action … Divide these “single” tests into Issues for Scrum Board prior to coding.

Our group decided to use Google Drawings to mock up what our website will look like. We have decided to use Bootstrap in order to design the components. The adjusted plan includes random quotes that people can like rather than posting their own. . UI Design . . In this picture as you, the design shows inspiration quotes from prevalent speakers such as DJ Khaled and Martin Luther King Jr. This satisfies the Collegeboard criteria as follows: . Program Purpose &amp; Function . A website to display random inspirational quotes | Users can create accounts and save quotes by liking them | Allow users to share there goals and find new quotes | . Data Abstraction . We will store user data . Number of likes | Number of comments | Comments messages | Quotes | Data will be stored in a SQLite relational database | Data will be accessed using the sqlite3 library, a Python interface for SQLite | . Procedural Abstraction . We will implement separate functions and HTML templates for different views | Quote API abstraction using a function to access the RapidAPI | . Algorithm Implementation . The software development will employ Linux Ubuntu OS, VS Code, HTML, JavaScript, Python and Github will be used to host the code. Following are some of the DB fields . User ID | Follower ID | Likes | Messages | Quotes | . Testing . The Striver website will emply manual testing. After code is developed unit testing will be done by the developeer and integration testing will be done in phases. We’ll use of print statements to debug API issues. . Release . There will be multiple releases os the product and one final releases. We make a build everyday for team members to test. . Roles . Here are the Roles for our Project .

            "content": "Question 1: . Define Economics, explaining the Economic Problem. . Economics is a social science which looks at how resources are allocated and is the study of who gets the resources. Scarcity is an economic problem. People have wants and needs but the resources to fulfill those needs and wants are limited. Therefore, society has to come up with systems that determine who gets what. . Question 2: . List and define the four Factors of Production. . Four Factors of Production(FOPs) are: Land, labor, capital and entrepreneurship. . Land: This refers to natural resources. Examples are water, minerals, trees and oil. . Labor: This refers to work people do in the production of goods and services. Examples are factory workers, teachers, waiters, farmers . Capital: This refers to man-made factors of production. Examples are machinery, tools, equipment, factories, road, and harbors used in the production process. . Entrepreneurship: This refers to those risk-takers who organize the factors of production into goods and services. . Question 3: . Explain the difference between tradeoffs and opportunity costs, using the example of eating food. . Trade offs are used when you need to sacrifice an object in order to gain another object. For example, in order to make oreo icecream you need to crush Oreos (that you already have and could eat plain) into the icecream. But instead of eating just plain Oreos you gave them up in order to make the Oreo icecream, you can no longer eat the oreos that you once had. In opportunity costs, you never had the oreos, you could either make the oreos or a chocolate chip cookie using batter. If you decide to make the cookies the opportunity cost are the oreos,unlike the tradeoff where you had the oreos to begin with. . Question 4: . The following table represents the combinations of goods that Bakeryland can make using its resources. Use this information to answer the questions that follow: .   A B C D E F G . Cookies | 12 | 10 | 8 | 6 | 4 | 2 | 0 | . Cupcakes | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | . Create a diagram of this data with cookies on the vertical axis and cupcakes on the horizontal axis. . | . Assume Bakeryland is currently producing at point A, 12 cookies and 0 cupcakes. . What is the opportunity cost of increasing the production of cupcakes from 0 to 1? The loss of __2___ cookies. . | What is the opportunity cost of increasing the production of cupcakes from 1 to 2? The loss of __2____ cookies. . | What is the opportunity cost of moving from C to D? 2 cookies . | What is the opportunity cost of moving from D to E? 2 cookies . | What is the opportunity cost of moving from F to G? 2 cookies . | | c. Is this is an example of constant or increasing opportunity costs? . This is an example of constant opportunity costs . Question 5 . The following table represents the combinations of goods that Strangeland can make using its resources. Use this information to answer the questions that follow: .   A B C D . Robots | 12 | 10 | 6 | 0 | . Cheese | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | . Create a diagram of this data with robots on the vertical axis and cheese on the horizontal axis. . | . Assume Strangeland is currently producing at point A, 12 robots and 0 units of cheese. . The opportunity cost of increasing production of cheese from 0 to 1 unit is the loss of _2___ units of robots. . | The opportunity cost of increasing production of cheese from 1 unit to 2 units is the loss of ___4____ units of robots. . | The opportunity cost of moving from point C to point D is ______6 units of robots_______. . | | c. Is this is an example of constant or increasing opportunity costs? . This is an example of increasing opportunity costs . Question 6 . In the example in question 5 above, if point F lies outside of the PPC, what does this tell you? . If point F lies outside of the PPC, then we need increasing supply of resources, which cannot be attained with the existing resources . Question 7 . In the example in question 5 above, if point G lies inside of the PPC, what does this tell you? . If point G lies inside the PPC, it shows unemployment and idle factors of production . Question 8 . Draw a PPC for Donuts and Cell Phones, showing changes for each of the following conditions: . New technology makes factories more productive. . | Increases production possibilities for both the doughnut and the phones . . There’s a decrease in the demand for donuts. . | A change in demand does not shift the curve . . Dairy farmers go out of business, and butter is a resource for donuts. . | A shift inward only for doughnuts . . Many workers are unemployed. . | Curve does not shift. Unemployment is just a point inside the curve . . Workers receive improved healthcare. . | Quality of workers improved and the curve shift outward . . Question 9 . Explain the difference between productive efficiency and allocative efficiency. . Productive efficiency is possible combinations of goods a country can produce given its available resources. Any point on the PPC curve is productively efficient. Allocative efficiency is optimal distribution of goods and services. For this, we need to know what combination of the two goods society most wants. . Question 10 . How is economic growth shown on a PPC? Explain. . Economic growth is shown when the PPC curve is shifted outward. This shows how there is a higher demand for both products because of increase in people’s affordability.. Higher affordability shows higher economic growth. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
