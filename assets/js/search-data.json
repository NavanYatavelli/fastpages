Machine Learning Visit Tutorials Point . Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

Panda Hacks Explanation . I used Pandas utilities in the code cell above. Using the available data of Anthropometric Measurements of Olympic Champions, I created my own JSON dataset. I gathered information on the top 12 swimmers in history and used a variety of sources to confirm the accuracy of the data I was entering. The data in this instance consisted of five columns: height, weight, BMI, and swimmer time ranking based on speed. In order to list the top 5 fastest swimmers, the tallest, shortest, and strongest swimmers, the average swimmer height, the median swimmer weight, and the BMI mode value, I sorted this data and utilized Panda. I listed count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum using Panda&#39;s unique descriptive statistics tool. .",

Reading and Encoding Images (2 implementations follow) . PIL (Python Image Library) . Pillow or PIL provides the ability to work with images in Python. Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. PIL (Python Imaging Library) is an open-source library for image processing tasks that requires python programming language. PIL can perform tasks on an image such as reading, rescaling, saving in different image formats. PIL can be used for Image archives, Image processing, Image display. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? . Base64 is similar to binary and hex, since it is an encoding format which can convert a normal string/number into a series of encoded characters. It is different from binary and hexadecimal in the base that it uses. Base64 uses base 64 (0-63), while binary uses base 2 (0-1) and hexadecimal uses base 16 (0-9 and A-F). . Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. . See the below code snippet . | . import base64 sample_string = &quot;Nav&quot; sample_string_bytes = sample_string.encode(&quot;ascii&quot;) base64_bytes = base64.b64encode(sample_string_bytes) base64_string = base64_bytes.decode(&quot;ascii&quot;) print(f&quot;Encoded string: {base64_string}&quot;) . Encoded string: TmF2 . numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. Numpy is a python library used for working with arrays and also provides mathematical functions like, sqrt, sin, etc. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? | . I have seen buffering mostly when streaming videos online either on TV or on mobile phones . From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? . Streaming lags continuity and videos are not played continuously . | How do these effects apply to images? . Buffering can be used to add some edits to the features of images, such as, scaling - grey and red scale . | . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program. . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? | . Yes, this code seems like a series of steps are being performed to manipulate the images . Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? . All grayscale algorithms use the same basic three-step process: Get the red, green, and blue values of a pixel. Calculate the Average RGB of those numbers into a single gray value. Replace the original red, green, and blue values with the new gray value. . | Describe scale image? . Scale image is a feature allowing for the images to get scaled up or down in size. For example both base height and width of bigger image are scaled down. When scaling a image, a new image with a higher or lower number of pixels is generated. In the case of decreasing the pixel number (scaling down) this usually results in a visible quality loss. . | What is before and after on pixels in three images? . Before scaling, the pixels are of a larger size, but after the averages of all the pixels are taken, they are compressed down to a smaller size. In the example below, here is the scaled and original sizes- . Green Square Original size: (16, 16) Scaled size: (320, 320) . Clouds Impression Original size: (320, 234) Scaled size: (320, 234) . | Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? . Yes, scaling image ia a type of lossy compression.

Programming Paradigm Explanation . I used NumPy array to access and change to the RGB values of the pixels of Happy Face image. . Converted the happy face to red scale, green scale, or blue scale. . For red scale I added Red=+25 pixel color values but kept average values for Green and Blue scale. . For blue scale I added Blue=+25 pixel color values but kept average values for Green and Red scale. . For green scale I added Green=+25 pixel color values but kept average values for Red and Blue scale. . Printed meta data of the Happy Face like name, size etc. . Also added an extra meta field of Year. . Two Images representing Lossy and Lossless Compression . Lossy Compression . The lassen-volcano.jpg image will represent lossy compression. This is because if the image file is compressed, it will definitely have a drastically reduced file size, but the image quality will also go down, due to the very fine details in the image, and the variety of colors. It will likely become more fuzzy. . Lossless Compression . The green-square-16.png is an example of lossless compression. That image has one sole color, so the RGB pixel values are going to be the same every time, and the quality of the image will not deteriorate, while the image file size will still reduce .",

Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. . MIT License The software may be used, copied, modified, and distributed with permission. | The software has few limitations and can be used for both business and non-commercial enterprises. | Ensures that the original copyright and license information are included and permits anybody to use, alter, and distribute the licensed software for any reason, including commercial use. | . | GPL License Software users are free to use, alter, and distribute the software for any reason. | They can also choose to charge a fee or give it out for free. | Anyone who obtains a copy of the software must have access to the source code. | . | In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic. . The conditions under which software can be used, updated, and distributed are outlined in its license. | When thinking about ethical issues, digital rights like privacy and intellectual property rights are crucial. For instance, licensing can stop music from being copied illegally so that creators can claim credit for their work. | For software developers, this is crucial since it enables creators to maintain control over their work and defend their legal rights against data theft. | Digital rights, software licenses, and legal and ethical issues are all intricately intertwined and have an impact on how software is developed, distributed, and used. | . Make a license for your personal . The use of the program is more flexible under an MIT License. The GPL license mandates that derivative works be granted the same license as the software’s original version. For more freedom, we choose the MIT license. Code can be more easily distributed, which may be advantageous to other users. | This is our project License File | This is my personal License File | . Extra - Research . The objectives and principles of the open-source project and the community’s choices determine how popular certain licenses are. To encourage collaboration and the sharing of innovations, for instance, some projects can opt for the GPL, while others would opt for the Apache License 2.0, which permits commercial use and offers patent protection. Before selecting a license, it is crucial to understand its ramifications and how it will affect the demands and objectives of the open-source project in general. . From the Statista here is the percentage of most popular opensource license . . There are several popular open-source licenses, but the three most widely used licenses are: . MIT License: The MIT License is a permissive license that allows for the use of open-source software in commercial and non-commercial applications. It has minimal restrictions and is considered a simple license to understand and apply. . GPL (GNU General Public License): The GPL is a copyleft license that requires derivative works to also be released under the same license. This ensures that any modifications to the software must be open-sourced, promoting collaboration and sharing of improvements. . Apache License 2.0: The Apache License 2.0 is a permissive license that is similar to the MIT License but has a few additional provisions, such as a requirement to provide attribution and a patent grant. . 5.6 Safe Computing . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. . On the login page, you can see projects in CSP that include PII. People’s name and email are included in their login information when they access a website on our website. | . What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? . Since you may be followed online using PIIs, I believe they could be hazardous because I don’t want to be followed. It is crucial to make sure that the information you are providing is to a secure website where your information won’t be stolen because PIIs are required for login and the user experience. | . Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. . A strong password is one that is difficult for others to decipher and contains no personal information. | A bad password is abcdef or password123 or something that can be easily guessed. | . Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. . Symmetric encryption, Using the same key for both encryption and decryption, symmetric encryption is a quick and effective method of encryption | Asymmetric encryption, is when the encryption and decryption processes employ two separate keys. The private key, which is needed to decrypt the data and must be kept secret, is used to encrypt the data and is widely distributed. | . Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. . AES-512 encryption . Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. . People using phony lotteries to steal personal information is an example of phishing I’ve witnessed. People will text you requesting your address and other personal information after telling you that you have won money. It’s not good. | Malicious websites, voicemails, and emails are examples of further phishing. | . Extra - Research . NIST Guidelines for Password Protection. . NIST recommends a password policy that requires all user-created passwords to be at least 8 characters in length | All machine-generated passwords to be at least 6 characters in length. | Additionally, NIST recommended to allow passwords to be at least 64 characters as a maximum length. | . Here are the ways to keep our Passwords Strong and Secure . Use a password manager to keep track of your passwords | Write your login credentials down and save it safely(yes!!) | Find out if your passwords have been stolen. Mozilla’s Firefox Monitor and Google’s Password Checkup can show you which of your email addresses and passwords have been compromised in a data breach so you can take action | Avoid common words and character combinations in your password | Longer passwords are better: 8 characters is a starting point | Don’t recycle your passwords | Avoid using passwords known to be stolen | No need to periodically reset your password | Use two-factor authentication. | . Commonly used &amp; breached passwords . Passwords that are known to be commonly used or compromised should not be used again. | For example, we should disallow passwords in lists from breaches. | The Have I Been Pwned? database, contains 570+ million passwords from breaches, previously used passwords, well-known commonly used passwords, and context-specific passwords. | Here is the link to Have I Been Pwned? | .",

Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? . Facebook users between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four make up 18% of all users. 29.9% of Facebook users, or the majority, are between the ages of 25 and 34. While Facebook targets an older demographic, TikTok targets a younger one, with 25 percent of its users being between the ages of 10 and 19. Both society and the real app developers are to blame for the exclusion between the applications. Younger consumers enjoy the fast-paced videos that TikTok produces. This might hurt younger viewers, which makes it hazardous. Although it is detrimental to society and has to be changed, having a specific audience for an app is also beneficial from a commercial standpoint. . Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? . Female voices are used in virtual assistants because they are more eloquent and facilitate audience comprehension. This was done on purpose since consumers may find virtual assistants more enticing if they can understand what the assistant is saying. In a way, it is damaging since it can indicate that women should only have assistant positions. . Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google) . Amazon is an algorithm that affects my choices. I do a lot of internet shopping. And I frequently purchase items I find intriguing on Amazon. Therefore, the majority of my days are spent browsing Amazon and making purchases there. . Pair Disussion Questions . Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? . No, they do not think that this was intentional . If yes or no, justify your conclusion. . Although he believes it was unintentional, he also believes it to be incorrect and that it has to be corrected. . How do you think this happened? . I think that the programming and testing were done on or for white folks. Most likely, it wasn’t tested on or programmed for black folks. . Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? . This is detrimental, no doubt. It could alter how young Black Americans regard themselves and damage their self-esteem. But I think this was an oversight and wasn’t meant to exclude. . Should it be corrected? . Yes, it has to be changed. A consumer has a right to anticipate that all functionalities of a computer they purchase will function. . What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? . I believe we should test the algorithm on individuals of all various races in order to obtain a better result. In order to improve the product, we might also need user feedback and thoughts regarding the result. . Big Idea 5.4 - Crowdsourcing . Obtaining Data via Crowdsourcing . We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through API’s, namely RapidAPI. This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data. Discuss APIs you have used. . Some of the APIs that I have used was the google maps API. This API let me be able to set markers/ locations on a useable google maps screen that I was able to implement into my groups website. . We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students. Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history. What is the biggest discovery you have found in GitHub? . The biggest discovery and most interesting part of GitHub was the fact that you were able to see when and how many times you pushed/ updated code through GitHub. The site was able to record and save that data for later viewing. . Kaggle datasets for code and science exploration. The avenue of data points us youtube or netflix channels. Analyzing crowd data helps us make decisions. Exam top 10 to 20. Did you see anything interesting? . I noticed a data set on the mental health of medical students on Kaggle. This intrigued me since it’s important to discuss about medical students’ mental health, which is rarely done. It could aid young people in deciding if they want to sacrifice their mental health to attend medical school. . Hacks . CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? . We could develop a platform for coding homework assistance given the high number of computer science students we have. When we are stuck on a particular assignment, we may ask others to email us the relevant sections of their functioning code, post it on the platform, and provide an explanation of the code. We would have the ability to query and be questioned. . What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? . Yes, our project would be much better. This is because we would be able to use our news website in order to reach more people with more diverse needs and wants. We could send people who only care about sports our sports section, or the people who only care about the latest news the newest section. . What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. . During Night at the Mueseum, we can ask all of the people that are there at the school what their most favorite/ interesting news segment in. Whether that be sports, breaking news, or whatever else. Then later we will be able to push more of the news that the majority of the people want to see towards the home page, so that it is easier to access and read. .",

We’ve been working on creating a news website for our Create Performance Task (group) that offers users up-to-date news updates with many cool, new features that current news sites don’t currently offer, like cutting-edge sports predictors, trackers, and analytics, places for YOU to update your own breaking news events and even local news that you’d like to make the public more aware of, and the most secure algorithms implemented to keep user data safe. .

The program’s function and purpose have already been decided upon by me, and they will be explicitly outlined in my write-up and movie. In addition, I will be able to test it, and after developing the login and signup pages and after it is completely working, I will be able to go into greater detail to describe the methods used, how complexity was controlled using lists, and other things. . I’ll demonstrate how a user registers, sets up an account, customizes it, and modifies their preferences—like the status of their newsletter subscription or notification—in the account page of their account. I might even demonstrate how they modify their usernames and passwords—in the video. .",

Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0 | The 14-second video led me to believe that the program displayed the input (the command that was being executed) and the computer&#39;s output, which was a table of values for each triangle side. Additionally, the functionality of the software was discussed in the write-up. The response did not &quot;specify the program&#39;s goal,&quot; according to the College Board&#39;s justification for giving this submission a 0 in this category. This response received a 0, as CB will issue a 0 if even one component of the criteria is lacking. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | There were 2 program code segments; in the writeup, the name of the variable that represented the list was utilized, and the submission discussed the information in the sides list and its function in the overall program. It discusses how without the list and its information, the program would not have operated. The College Board approved of this grade. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The submission&#39;s paper omitted any discussion of the named list&#39;s (sideIndex) role in the program&#39;s complexity management. CB awarded the proposal a 0/1 for this score category and agreed with this assessment. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student-developed procedure is ratioCalculate, and there&#39;s one student-developed procedure and another code segment where that procedure is being called. In the writeup, the submission also talks about how that ratioCalculate procedure contributes to the functionality of the program. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | In the writeup, there is a program code segment which talks about the student-developed algorithm ratioCalculate, which includes all of the CB requirements. The writeup is very descriptive in regards to this algorithm, which is why CB also gave the submission a 1/1 in this category. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | This deserved a 1/1, since the writeup showed two calls to the procedure with different arguments, and the conditions which were tested for each of those calls were described. Finally, the response showed the results for each of those calls, and therefore, meeting all the requirements for this scoring section, CB also gave it a 1/1. | . . Submission #2 . Reporting Category | Student Score | CB Score | Comments | . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | In the video demonstrating the software in action, it can be seen that there is user input from the player placing the tiles on the grid and output from the game&#39;s operation. The simulation is then demonstrated in action. The submission&#39;s writeup discusses the goal of the program, the functionality seen in the video, and the input/output of the program (explicitly written in writeup). This assessment was supported by CB, who also rated them a 1/1. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The post includes two distinct code portions that demonstrate how data is maintained. It provides the list&#39;s name (startGrid) and a description of its contents. It satisfies all conditions, and both CB&#39;s and I rated it a 1/1. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | In the writeup (3.b.v), the submission talks about how doing the task with variables or another method would be incredibly complex, and then talks about how they used a list to manage that complexity. This is why I gave it a 1/1, and CB did as well. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The replaceList procedure is talked about in the writeup, and in the writeup, it also talks about how the procedure contributes to the functionality of the program and its necessity. Therefore, it deserved a 1/1 and CB agreed. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The submission talks about the replaceList procedure and the algorithmic implementation within it. The writeup is very specific in regards to the algorithm and the procedure that its located in, meeting all the requirements, so it deserved a 1/1. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | CB concurred that the tests earned a 1/1. The two calls to the procedure that help the program&#39;s various code segments run are discussed in the write-up. The write-up also discusses the procedure call circumstances that are being examined, followed by the outcomes of the two procedure calls. | .",

Reflection (Vocab ) . A simulation is an simpler abstraction of an very complicated natural phenomena. Simulations help for people to learn more and predict important data which they can use to better improve algorithms and products. Simulations are often much cheaper and have no safety limits compared to real life experiments. I found these problems to be a little challenging, but a good review of simulations. Simulations are needed for modeling complicated situations in a much simpler way so that any user can still manage most aspects of the model without delving into complexities. . Extra Simulation . import random print(&quot;==========================================================&quot;) print(&quot;Simulation of the gender of the newly born -- 1000 Pandas!&quot;) print(&quot;==========================================================&quot;) births = 1000 # sample size male_pandas = 0 female_pandas = 0 for i in range(births): gender = random.randint(0,1) # get a random number between 0 and 1 if gender == 1: # head male_pandas = male_pandas + 1 else: # tail female_pandas = female_pandas + 1 print(&#39;Number of newly born pandas are male:&#39;, male_pandas, &quot; and their percentage is &quot;, (100*male_pandas/births), &quot;%&quot; ) print(&#39;Number of newly born pandas are female:&#39;, female_pandas, &quot; and their percentage is &quot;, (100*female_pandas/births), &quot;%&quot; ) . Output . ====================================================== Simulation of the gender of newly born -- 1000 Pandas! ====================================================== Number of newly born pandas are male: 493 and their percentage is 49.3 % Number of newly born pandas are female: 507 and their percentage is 50.7 % . Here is a simulation of a pandas birth, which accurately simulates how many male or female pandas would be born if there were 1000 births. Using a simulation is much more efficient, better and replicates the real world situation. The simulation here also caluclates the percentage of male vs female born. In both cases the percentage is closer to 50%. .",

            "content": "Unit 3 Sections 14-15 Homework . Reflection . Documentation is important for others or for yourself to understand your code later on. This lesson emphasized ways that which code can be efficiently and effectively written through use of libraries, documentation, and APIs. Libraries consist of pre-written code that can be utilizing in other programs. They help to simplify code by storing code segments and features in a separate place, this way, the code being run only has code that the user has written. A library’s documentation describes the different features of a library. Libraries are collections of code and scripts that can provide faster solvents to problems. . Problem 2: Multiple Choice . (1) What does the random(a,b) function generate? . A. A random integer from a to be exclusive | B. A random integer from a to b inclusive. | C. A random word from variable a to variable b exclusive. | D. A random word from variable a to variable b inclusive. | . (2) What is x, y, and z in random.randrange(x, y, z)? . A. x = start, y = stop, z = step | B. x = start, y = step, z = stop | C. x = stop, y = start, z = step | D. x = step, y = start, z = stop | . (3) Which of the following is NOT part of the random library? . A. random.item | B. random.random | C. random.shuffle | D. random.randint | . Problem 3: Short Answer Questions . (1) What is the advantage of using libraries? . Libraries have a distinct advantage of having pre-written code that can provide efficiency at a linear level. Libraries help to simplify complex programs by allowing the code to reference pre-written code. This reduces the workload for the user writing the code and improves reliability. This cuts out time that the user has to write repetitive code. The user can spend more time on the creative and work process then repetitive code writing. . (2) Write a thorough documentation of the following code. . import random # Saves user input in the in the comma seperated format names_string = input(&quot;Give me everybody&#39;s names, seperated by a comma.&quot;) # splits the stored user input by the character, comma, and stores each element in the list names names = names_string.split(&quot;,&quot;) # get the length of names num_items = len(names) # get random number within &lt; num_items random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items - 1) # figuring out randomly who to play person_who_will_pay = names[random_choice] # Prints the name random person name with message print(f&quot;{person_who_will_pay} is going to buy the meal today!&quot;) . Output . Brady is going to buy the meal today! . Problem 4: Coding Challenges! . (1) Create a program to pick five random names from a list of at least 15 names . import random # list of random names random_names = [&quot;Aaron Rodgers&quot;,&quot;Rob Gronkowski&quot;, &quot;Patrick Mahomes&quot;, &quot;Odell Beckham &quot;, &quot;Ben Roethlisberger&quot;, &quot;Russell Wilson&quot;, &quot;Cam Newton&quot;, &quot;Lamar Jackson&quot;, &quot;Antonio Brown&quot;, &quot;JJ Watt&quot;, &quot;Adrian Peterson&quot;, &quot;Keira&quot;, &quot;Deshaun Watson&quot;, &quot; Lionel Messi&quot;, &quot;Jerry Rice&quot;] i = 0 # printing 5 random names print(&quot;The five random names are:&quot;) while i &lt; 5: print(random.choice(random_names)) i += 1 . Output . Lamar Jackson Ben Roethlisberger Russell Wilson Adrian Peterson Deshaun Watson . (2) Create a program to simulate a dice game where each player rolls two fair dice (6 sides); the player with the greater sum wins . import random def playerA(): firstRoll = 0 firstRoll = random.randrange(1,6) secondRoll = 0 secondRoll = random.randrange(1,6) score = firstRoll + secondRoll return score def playerB(): firstRoll = 0 firstRoll = random.randrange(1,6) secondRoll = 0 secondRoll = random.randrange(1,6) score = firstRoll + secondRoll return score first = playerA() print(&quot;First Player rolled&quot;,first) second = playerB() print(&quot;Second Player rolled&quot;,second) if (first &gt; second): print(&quot;First Player won!&quot;) else: print(&quot;Second Player won!&quot;) . Output . First Player rolled 3 Second Player rolled 8 Second Player won! . EXTRA-CREDIT OPPORTUNITY: Create a program to randomly generate one of those 5x5 square CollegeBoard robot courses frequently seen in these lessons . EXTRA X 2: Put safeguards in your program to make sure the robot course is actually possible to complete. . import random # This &gt; is Start # This O is End # These # are obstacles print(&quot;Generating 3 randomized 5x5 squares:&quot;) count = 0 directions = [&quot;up&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;] while count &lt; 3: grid = [[&#39;_&#39; for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(5)] direction = random.choice(directions) obstacles = 12 for i in range(obstacles): row = random.randint(0, 4) col = random.randint(0, 4) grid[row][col] = &#39;#&#39; finish_row = random.randint(0, 4) finish_column = random.randint(0, 4) grid[finish_row][finish_column] = &#39;O&#39; start_row = random.randint(0, 4) start_column = random.randint(0, 4) grid[start_row][start_column] = &#39;&gt;&#39; print(&quot;Initial Direction: &quot; + direction) for row in grid: print(&#39; &#39;.join(row)) print(&quot;==========&quot;) count = count + 1 .

Notes Taken During the Presentation . It is important for girls to be in engineering and computer science because these fields are crucial for shaping the future of technology and innovation. Girls bring a unique perspective and set of experiences to the table, which can help lead to the development of new ideas and solutions to problems. Furthermore, having more diversity in these fields can help break down stereotypes and biases, leading to a more inclusive and equitable industry. . It is important to keep trying even when you fail in engineering and computer science. These fields can be challenging, and it is natural to face obstacles and setbacks. However, it is important to persevere and not let failure discourage you. Instead, use failure as an opportunity to learn and grow, and to develop new strategies and approaches. With determination and hard work, you can overcome any challenge and achieve your goals in engineering and computer science. .",

Question 3 HACK . { if MOVE_FORWARD_ALLOWED{ moveForwards } else{ if TURN_RIGHT_ALLOWED{ turnright } if TURN_LEFT_ALLOWED{ turnleft } } } . Question 4 &amp; 5 . . Explanation: We would start our search for element 69 by looking at the middle index, 5 first (8 elements divide by 2, plus 1 index). We find 6. 6 being less than 69 would lead you to consider the greater than half. The middle index for this section is Seven (5+9 = 14/2 = 7). Index number seven is 11, which is lower than index number 69. The eighth index is next examined ((8+8)/2 = 8). We searched and discovered the right number because 8 = 69. . Question 6 Diagram . . Question 7 . Shown as below in alphabetical order, ascending, place these in this order. As numbers are greater, you can compare which numerical value of these ascii characters is greater, allowing these to be correctly compared. . [&quot;Market”, ”Ralphs”, “store”, &quot;Target”, ”Walmart”] . Question 8 HACK . The binary search automatically rules out half of the options with each iteration, it is much faster than sequential search. Since you begin at the middle index, you can either select the group that is higher or lower than the middle index. As a result, each time you divide, you will eliminate half of the potential outcomes. . Question 9 HACK . From the list [64,36,16,11,9], we should be looking for number 36. First, I would choose the middle element ((1+5)/2 = 3), and since 16 is less than 36, I would shift back (as the list is reversed). As a result, I would choose the second element (1+3/2 = 2), which equals 36, therefore it would take me just two tries to reach 36. .",

Rather, it returns a new list with the values at indices j and k interchanged. Video Notes: Topic is Program Design and Development How is a program developed? Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan Sometimes the development is more exploratory than anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens Investigation is an important step in the process Developers must: Determine the requirements of the program Understand the constraints Understand the user concerns and interests How do developers investigate Surveys User testing Interviews Direct observation Developers design program by Brainstorming Storyboarding the program Planning the user experience Laying out the user interface Organizing into modules . 28: This code segment incorrectly charges customers who use more than 25 units of electricity. These customers are charged $7 per unit for all units, when they should be charged this rate only for the number of units above 25. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 – 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174. This code segment would incorrectly charge the customer $224 for the 32 units. Video Notes Topic: Conditionals Algorithm: a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task Selection: Given a parameter the algorithm uses its instructions to determine if it needs to return true or false. EX: If statements Evaluates a conditional and return true or false statement . 30: Introducing a list to a program makes it more likely that the program will attempt to access an index beyond the length of the list, not less likely. Video Notes: Topic is Data Abstraction Strings An ordered sequence of characters May contain letters, numbers and all other special characters Ex: Words, phrases, sentences, ID numbers, etc. Lists An ordered sequence of elements Each element is a variable Ex: Playlists of songs, Names of students in a school, contacts in your phone, etc List Index Each element of a string is referenced by an index The index starts at 1 . Essential Information A list is an ordered sequence of elements An element is an individual value in a list that is assigned a unique index An index is a common method for referencing the elements in a list or string using natural numbers A string is an ordered sequence of characters . 45: The if condition (value &gt; 0) in the for loop where count1 is updated for theList values 1,2. So the count-1 =2. The else condition of (value &gt; 0) in the for loop where count2 is updated for theList values -2,-1,0. So the count-2 =3. . Notes of all the questions answered below . Result is equal to 2 which is multiplied by 5,when the procedure is ran 3 times which displays the resulting value | When the variable x is positive or 0, then Y will become False, so when it is put into the IF statement, the process will not go through because it is relayed as false instead of true | All of the other answers are all benefits that would not harm the team | The first two reasons, location as well as the dietary restrictions are both needed. However, the third and last reasons, the need for finding the username are not needed because in order to find other users the app finds it using the contacts of the original user | Three is the only right answer because Brandon’s phone contacts is not needed in order find other restaurants that don’t have the restrictions. Past restaurants are also not needed to be known in order to find new restaurants in the area. | The variable will keep getting 2 added to it until the variable is greater than the MAX variable. The first variable keeps on going even when it is equal to or less than the MAX variable. | The denominator must not be 0 ever, if the denominator is zero then the equation becomes impossible to calculate. The equation becomes undefined. | Newlist is making a copy of the numlist and interchanging the elements at J and K. Counting is also started at 1 instead of zero and the command LENGTH(numlist) counts all of the numbers that are available inside of the list, when counting these numbers it creates an end value which when placed back in the code cannot be passed. | Score- penalty must be 0 or positive and the current commands and code do not satisfy the command and will cause it to fail. So line 7 must be changed with line 3. | doing the work independently is not good for collaboration and can cause bigger failures and blocks in code writing | The outer loop iterates from j = 1 to myList length-1. Assigns k = j+1. The inner loop iterates from k=j+1 to myList length. If condition compares j’th and k’th values of myList. The code segment iterates through myList, comparing each element to all subsequent elements in the list and makes containsDuplicates = true if equal. | The user should not be made to put in the cost of the product, if that were true then they can pay whatever price they had wanted for the food. | If the contents of myList contained [-1, 0, 1] then the procedure will not return the intended result. This is because when the code is running, it will look at the first value and return false. However, it will keep on returning the next two values as true and in the end will ultimately return true even though a negative value is present. | 8 is greater than 7 so it will get passed in the first if statement, to correct this part of the code the first if statement should be replaced with &gt;8. The second problem is that 6 is less than 7 so it goes to the else statement which makes it display a check which is wrong. | The users should not be able to do much relating with the code, they can however provide different perspectives to the developers that provide new problems/ challenges which need to be overcome. | When answering this question I was stuck on answer one and answer two, I had known that the messages were needed to be sent in packets so the other two answers could not be correct, however I was not sure whether or not | Open protocols on the Internet helps – a way to standardize data transmission between different devices | Relationship between the World Wide Web and the Internet – WWW can be considered as linked pages, programs, and files. And Internet is the Network to access WWW | With 4 bits binary we can store decimal numbers from 0 to 15. Anything above decimal 15 cannot be accommodated in 4 bits – so 29 is an overflow. | With 4 bits binary we can store 16 values from 0 to 15. So Four bits are enough to store the eight directions. | Binary sequences are represented as 0,1s. Any information can be encoded using binary sequences. | The binary sequence 0011, 0110, and 1111 represent 33, 6 and 15. 9 is missing. | Analog data can be best represented in digital if we sample at regular intervals and convert into digital. | Binary 1011, 1101 are 11 and 13. So increasing order is 5, 11, 12, 13 | Age is an integer number and not boolean, string or collection | The variable isOpen has to represent true or false – hence Boolean is correct | Code should be Readable and hence – variables should have meaningful names such as studentName which is String and isAbsent that is Boolean. | The logic cost = numUnits(5) for less than or equals to 25 seems correct. Also for &gt;25 is correct in C. | List can grow at runtime. We can add, modify or delete elements as needed | The benefit of using a list as a data abstraction in this logic is – keeping the numeric values in a list makes it easier to apply the same computation to every data element. | In this myWord the element at index 3 of wordList is “ghi”. myChar the character at index 2 of myWord is “h” | myList is copied to yourList | Values greater than equal to 90 are printed | Copied in this sequence [“guitar”, “drums”, “bass”] → firstList → thirdList → secondList | The logic time &gt; 120 makes maxPS = 30 otherwise maxPS =50 is selected | Appending 2*i where i ranges from 1 to 10 – would store ten consecutive even integers, beginning with 2, in the list evenList. | To swap the values in two variables num1 → temp and num2 → num1 and finally temp → num2 | Word2 is not changed.

Our group decided to use Google Drawings to mock up what our website will look like. We have decided to use Bootstrap in order to design the components. The adjusted plan includes random quotes that people can like rather than posting their own. . UI Design . . In this picture as you, the design shows inspiration quotes from prevalent speakers such as DJ Khaled and Martin Luther King Jr. This satisfies the Collegeboard criteria as follows: . Program Purpose &amp; Function . A website to display random inspirational quotes | Users can create accounts and save quotes by liking them | Allow users to share there goals and find new quotes | . Data Abstraction . We will store user data . Number of likes | Number of comments | Comments messages | Quotes | Data will be stored in a SQLite relational database | Data will be accessed using the sqlite3 library, a Python interface for SQLite | . Procedural Abstraction . We will implement separate functions and HTML templates for different views | Quote API abstraction using a function to access the RapidAPI | . Algorithm Implementation . The software development will employ Linux Ubuntu OS, VS Code, HTML, JavaScript, Python and Github will be used to host the code. Following are some of the DB fields . User ID | Follower ID | Likes | Messages | Quotes | . Testing . The Striver website will emply manual testing. After code is developed unit testing will be done by the developeer and integration testing will be done in phases. We’ll use of print statements to debug API issues. . Release . There will be multiple releases os the product and one final releases. We make a build everyday for team members to test. . Roles . Here are the Roles for our Project .

Remember, people who make good choices don’t break the law. Each fish has a current market value (again fish types may vary) . . CONCLUSIONS . Discuss any significant trends illustrated in carrying out this exercise. . At the beginning of the experiment me and my group realized that is much easier to catch fish and sell them due to an abundance of fish. At the end of the experiment, due to the overfishing of fish the population had declined and it was harder to catch anything. . Did your fishing group talk about the harvesting approach that would be taken during each season? What was your decision if one was reached? . Our fishing group talked about the harvesting approach that would be taken during each season. Our decision after the discussion was that we would incorporate a law that would only allow us to catch a certain amount of fish every time we fished. This fishing policy would make the fish to have enough time to repopulate and get back to their correct population. . Compare your group’s results with the other groups. Explain whether or not you think your group was successful in using the ocean’s resources in a sustainable manner. . After comparing our groups data to other groups - we realize that our group ( alont with many of the other groups) did not use the pond resources to keep the pond fishes sustainable. We realized that we have overfished and as a result to that the fish population has decreased gradually. The overfishing made it more harder to fish and resluted in less abundance of fish in the pond. We were not successful in using the pond resources in a sustainable manner. .",

The “restocking” procedure at the conclusion of each fishing season remains the same: one “new” fish of the same “species” is added for every two fish of that species remaining. . | What happens when BALDMAN (the company/person that restocks fish) runs out of fish?

Discuss any significant trends illustrated in carrying out this exercise. . | At the beginning of the experiment me and my group realized that is much easier to catch fish and sell them due to an abundance of fish. At the end of the experiment, due to the overfishing of fish the population had declined and it was harder to catch anything. . Did your fishing group talk about the harvesting approach that would be taken during each season? What was your decision if one was reached? . | Our fishing group talked about the harvesting approach that would be taken during each season. Our decision after the discussion was that we would incorporate a law that would only allow us to catch a certain amount of fish every time we fished. This fishing policy would make the fish to have enough time to repopulate and get back to their correct population. . Compare your group’s results with the other groups. Explain whether or not you think your group was successful in using the ocean’s resources in a sustainable manner. . | After comparing our groups data to other groups - we realize that our group ( alont with many of the other groups) did not use the pond resources to keep the pond fishes sustainable. We realized that we have overfished and as a result to that the fish population has decreased gradually. The overfishing made it more harder to fish and resluted in less abundance of fish in the pond. We were not successful in using the pond resources in a sustainable manner. .",

            "title": "Ap Economics",
            "content": "Question 1: . Define Economics, explaining the Economic Problem. . Economics is a social science which looks at how resources are allocated and is the study of who gets the resources. Scarcity is an economic problem. People have wants and needs but the resources to fulfill those needs and wants are limited. Therefore, society has to come up with systems that determine who gets what. . Question 2: . List and define the four Factors of Production. . Four Factors of Production(FOPs) are: Land, labor, capital and entrepreneurship. . Land: This refers to natural resources. Examples are water, minerals, trees and oil. . Labor: This refers to work people do in the production of goods and services. Examples are factory workers, teachers, waiters, farmers . Capital: This refers to man-made factors of production. Examples are machinery, tools, equipment, factories, road, and harbors used in the production process. . Entrepreneurship: This refers to those risk-takers who organize the factors of production into goods and services. . Question 3: . Explain the difference between tradeoffs and opportunity costs, using the example of eating food. . Trade offs are used when you need to sacrifice an object in order to gain another object. For example, in order to make oreo icecream you need to crush Oreos (that you already have and could eat plain) into the icecream. But instead of eating just plain Oreos you gave them up in order to make the Oreo icecream, you can no longer eat the oreos that you once had. In opportunity costs, you never had the oreos, you could either make the oreos or a chocolate chip cookie using batter. If you decide to make the cookies the opportunity cost are the oreos,unlike the tradeoff where you had the oreos to begin with. . Question 4: . The following table represents the combinations of goods that Bakeryland can make using its resources. Use this information to answer the questions that follow: .   A B C D E F G . Cookies | 12 | 10 | 8 | 6 | 4 | 2 | 0 | . Cupcakes | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | . Create a diagram of this data with cookies on the vertical axis and cupcakes on the horizontal axis. . | . Assume Bakeryland is currently producing at point A, 12 cookies and 0 cupcakes. . What is the opportunity cost of increasing the production of cupcakes from 0 to 1? The loss of __2___ cookies. . | What is the opportunity cost of increasing the production of cupcakes from 1 to 2? The loss of __2____ cookies. . | What is the opportunity cost of moving from C to D? 2 cookies . | What is the opportunity cost of moving from D to E? 2 cookies . | What is the opportunity cost of moving from F to G? 2 cookies . | | c. Is this is an example of constant or increasing opportunity costs? . This is an example of constant opportunity costs . Question 5 . The following table represents the combinations of goods that Strangeland can make using its resources. Use this information to answer the questions that follow: .   A B C D . Robots | 12 | 10 | 6 | 0 | . Cheese | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | . Create a diagram of this data with robots on the vertical axis and cheese on the horizontal axis. . | . Assume Strangeland is currently producing at point A, 12 robots and 0 units of cheese. . The opportunity cost of increasing production of cheese from 0 to 1 unit is the loss of _2___ units of robots. . | The opportunity cost of increasing production of cheese from 1 unit to 2 units is the loss of ___4____ units of robots. . | The opportunity cost of moving from point C to point D is ______6 units of robots_______. . | | c. Is this is an example of constant or increasing opportunity costs? . This is an example of increasing opportunity costs . Question 6 . In the example in question 5 above, if point F lies outside of the PPC, what does this tell you? . If point F lies outside of the PPC, then we need increasing supply of resources, which cannot be attained with the existing resources . Question 7 . In the example in question 5 above, if point G lies inside of the PPC, what does this tell you? . If point G lies inside the PPC, it shows unemployment and idle factors of production . Question 8 . Draw a PPC for Donuts and Cell Phones, showing changes for each of the following conditions: . New technology makes factories more productive. . | Increases production possibilities for both the doughnut and the phones . . There’s a decrease in the demand for donuts. . | A change in demand does not shift the curve . . Dairy farmers go out of business, and butter is a resource for donuts. . | A shift inward only for doughnuts . . Many workers are unemployed. . | Curve does not shift. Unemployment is just a point inside the curve . . Workers receive improved healthcare. . | Quality of workers improved and the curve shift outward . . Question 9 . Explain the difference between productive efficiency and allocative efficiency. . Productive efficiency is possible combinations of goods a country can produce given its available resources. Any point on the PPC curve is productively efficient. Allocative efficiency is optimal distribution of goods and services. For this, we need to know what combination of the two goods society most wants. . Question 10 . How is economic growth shown on a PPC? Explain. . Economic growth is shown when the PPC curve is shifted outward. This shows how there is a higher demand for both products because of increase in people’s affordability.. Higher affordability shows higher economic growth. .",
