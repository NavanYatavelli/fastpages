<p>It is important for girls to be in engineering and computer science because these fields are crucial for shaping the future of technology and innovation. Girls bring a unique perspective and set of experiences to the table, which can help lead to the development of new ideas and solutions to problems. Furthermore, having more diversity in these fields can help break down stereotypes and biases, leading to a more inclusive and equitable industry.</p>

<p>It is important to keep trying even when you fail in engineering and computer science. These fields can be challenging, and it is natural to face obstacles and setbacks. However, it is important to persevere and not let failure discourage you. Instead, use failure as an opportunity to learn and grow, and to develop new strategies and approaches. With determination and hard work, you can overcome any challenge and achieve your goals in engineering and computer science.</p>
