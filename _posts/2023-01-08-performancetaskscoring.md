        <td>The 14-second video led me to believe that the program displayed the input (the command that was being executed) and the computer's output, which was a table of values for each triangle side. Additionally, the functionality of the software was discussed in the write-up. The response did not "specify the program's goal," according to the College Board's justification for giving this submission a 0 in this category. This response received a 0, as CB will issue a 0 if even one component of the criteria is lacking.</td>

        <td>1</td>
        <td>There were 2 program code segments; in the writeup, the name of the variable that represented the list was utilized, and the submission discussed the information in the sides list and its function in the overall program. It discusses how without the list and its information, the program would not have operated. The College Board approved of this grade.</td>

        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>The submission's paper omitted any discussion of the named list's (sideIndex) role in the program's complexity management. CB awarded the proposal a 0/1 for this score category and agreed with this assessment.</td>

        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>The student-developed procedure is ratioCalculate, and there's one student-developed procedure and another code segment where that procedure is being called. In the writeup, the submission also talks about how that ratioCalculate procedure contributes to the functionality of the program.</td>

        <td>Algorithm Implementation</td>

        <td>1</td>
        <td>In the writeup, there is a program code segment which talks about the student-developed algorithm ratioCalculate, which includes all of the CB requirements. The writeup is very descriptive in regards to this algorithm, which is why CB also gave the submission a 1/1 in this category.</td>

        <td>Testing</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>This deserved a 1/1, since the writeup showed two calls to the procedure with different arguments, and the conditions which were tested for each of those calls were described. Finally, the response showed the results for each of those calls, and therefore, meeting all the requirements for this scoring section, CB also gave it a 1/1.</td>

        <td>In the video demonstrating the software in action, it can be seen that there is user input from the player placing the tiles on the grid and output from the game's operation. The simulation is then demonstrated in action. The submission's writeup discusses the goal of the program, the functionality seen in the video, and the input/output of the program (explicitly written in writeup). This assessment was supported by CB, who also rated them a 1/1.</td>

        <td>The post includes two distinct code portions that demonstrate how data is maintained. It provides the list's name (startGrid) and a description of its contents. It satisfies all conditions, and both CB's and I rated it a 1/1.</td>

        <td>Managing Complexity</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>In the writeup (3.b.v), the submission talks about how doing the task with variables or another method would be incredibly complex, and then talks about how they used a list to manage that complexity. This is why I gave it a 1/1, and CB did as well.</td>

        <td>1</td>
        <td>The submission talks about the replaceList procedure and the algorithmic implementation within it. The writeup is very specific in regards to the algorithm and the procedure that its located in, meeting all the requirements, so it deserved a 1/1.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Testing</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>CB concurred that the tests earned a 1/1. The two calls to the procedure that help the program's various code segments run are discussed in the write-up. The write-up also discusses the procedure call circumstances that are being examined, followed by the outcomes of the two procedure calls.</td>
