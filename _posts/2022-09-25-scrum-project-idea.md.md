# Program purpose

Our Team creating a website called `Striver` that can keep track of your personal goals and share them with your peers. You will be able to like each other's goals and see a feed of goals that you and your friends have.

# Design

My team and I collaborated on a Google Drawing to mock up what our website will look like. We will use Bootstrap to design the components and Flask to template different pages. The like button will be an image that will switch to a different color once activated.

# SCRUM team role

My team and I decided on the following roles:

- Safin: SCRUM Master
- Kalani: Frontend
- Alex: Backend
- Navan: DevOps

As DevOps Lead , I'm the liaison between the other team members that contribute to software maintenance and creation with the purpose of making faster updates and writing code that is easy to update and access.The DevOps pipeline will be powered by GitHub Actions + some hosting provider (presumably AWS) . We intend to use HTML/CSS/JS for our frontend and Python on the backend.
