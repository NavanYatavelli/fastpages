# AppLab Ideas

## Planning:  Design 

The requirement for this task is to do a  3 question quiz. During the early stage of PLANing we spent considerable amount of time on coming up with ideas of Quiz. We discussed about quiz ideas of various topics ranging from Football, History, Countries and Cities. We finally narrowed down on the Countries since this would bring more versatile audience interested in playing the game.  You will be creating your own quiz with a partner on a topic of your choice. The most important thing you do before coding is to PLAN. 

As part of the Design -- we started doing the outline of the quiz rather than going straight to the coding. As part of the outline we listed out the flowchart of our game. It is a diagram of the sequence of movements and actions of interactions involved in our game. After multiple revisions of thinking, discussing, drawing and envisioning of our game steps -- we came up with the below flowchart as part of our design and planning.

## Daily Plans

To improve the quality of our implementation we planned on discussing about our plans daily atleast for 5 minutes on our current issues before embarking into work. This Daily Planning helped with our classroom focus and execution of building the Game, and its planning.

As part of our Daily plans while implementing our Design we wanted to implement the Instructions screen aswell. Here is the change to our Design after adding Instructions screen to our Game
