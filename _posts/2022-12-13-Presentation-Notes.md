- Remote workers got kicked out
- When you see companies shuffle, you have to go (don’t wait)
- Mysten labs??
Learning Highlights
- Continuous learning
- CCNA training
- Machine learning and Deep Learning
- Python
- Data Structures, Algorithms, Systems
- Rest APIs in his job at twitter
- Slowly movies to graph UL
Agile Methodology
- Technical perspective, different companies have their own version of agile, they use it
depending on what they need
- Qualcomm, - 150 engineers, interacted with each other, planned all of the work
for the quarter in a big meeting that last 2 day (good way to coordinate)
- Agile is important
Business landscape can change: Use Sprints
- Gone are the days where projects take 6 months
- What can we do in shorter time periods?
- That skillset is highly regarding
Machine Learning
- Learn how to use python libraries
- Use information on when to archive and delete repositories
- To cut costs
Questions:
Most important skill to have in the tech industry:
- Continuous learning
- Not just learning a particular programming language, but to learn everything
- Different companies have different stacks, everytime he moved companies he
had to learn new programming languages
- Everyone has different ways of doing things
- Don't be super concerned about things you read on the news
- In learning the skill to work with computers, that is self fulfilling
- Start ups are a risk
- Only risk is not learning (thats deep)
- Be adaptive
- Career path is zigzaggy
- Dated herself for 35 years
- Never thought she’d be doing what she’s doing
- Best technical people
- Listen to requirements
- Translate it in terms of how the technology can solve the requirements
- Help speak it to her
Biggest Challenges faced in the tech industry:
- She spent 14 years in qualcomm (semiconductor industry)
- Acquisitions?? Buy other companies
- The big fish in the pond (acquiring companies)
- Serial killers (but not quite)
- Interviews are ridiculous
- Interviews are a series of timed, random tests
- Could be a problem to solve in 30-45 minutes
- Code has to compile with no errors
How is your work-life balance:
- When you talk to a company, you're in a position to negotiate
- You're the one with the skill
- Some good companies, some bad

- He is interested in learning about block chain technology
- AWS and google cloud stuff at large companies

# Notes Taken During the Presentation
It is important for girls to be in engineering and computer science because these fields are crucial for shaping the future of technology and innovation. Girls bring a unique perspective and set of experiences to the table, which can help lead to the development of new ideas and solutions to problems. Furthermore, having more diversity in these fields can help break down stereotypes and biases, leading to a more inclusive and equitable industry.

It is important to keep trying even when you fail in engineering and computer science. These fields can be challenging, and it is natural to face obstacles and setbacks. However, it is important to persevere and not let failure discourage you. Instead, use failure as an opportunity to learn and grow, and to develop new strategies and approaches. With determination and hard work, you can overcome any challenge and achieve your goals in engineering and computer science.
