### Our Project:  JVNS News

I have been working extremely hard on a project called JNVS News with Vardaan, Justin, Shaurya, and me for the last couple of months. We had lots of issues leading up to N@TM, particularly when it came to integrating our frontend to our backend and deploying. Fortunately, we were able to identify several issues and their fixes prior to the start of N@TM. Our news site eventually became operational, and every feature—with the regrettable exception of mine—was powered by the Flask server we had set up. We had a lot of people approach our project at N@TM to snap photographs and inquire about its many aspects.If there is anything I would do differently the next time, I would make sure that we worked harder to improve the website's visual appeal before the presentation. A project will primarily attract an audience that includes many individuals who are unaware of programming or the challenges involved in generating certain features by seeming polished and aesthetically attractive.

In essence, this webiste was created to be a much simpler version of a game site. What good are sites if other games already exists, you might be asking. Since that most of those games are a paid service and have many adds after a certain number of games have been played and that users are unable to have a fun time enjoying thier game when many other popups are brought into their field of view and annoy them. this group has chosen to produce games for eager enjoyers of all ages. All of the runtime links in this category were stable and included features that operated as they would in a real project.

In their website I had also made my own account and had attempted in beating their highest record. The aim of the game was to click on the circles that popped up before the timer ran out, I was barley able to do this in time and was surprised when the high score had differed so much from mine. I deffinetly enjoyed the thought of less/ no adds in the game while I am playing the game. Even though an adblocker would work, sometimes the adds make the website glitchy and annoying to play on which is why I throughly enjoyed this gaming site made by akshat and azeem

I looked at the 3D Animation projects, which were produced using a program called Blender, after looking at a number of pictures. I had taken the course myself—3D Animation 1—during my first year of highschool, but the pandemic prevented me from participating in the N@TM component. The major project for 3D Animation 1 is the donut project, where you can style a doughnut to seem as realistic as you can and style the environment to look like an actual, lovely place where you could sit down and enjoy a donut. A project with a coastal location stood out to me the most.

The doughnut was placed on a table with a white tablecloth, a white plate, and gold-plated flatware. The room was painted light grey, and there was a window in the room. A vista of a blended blue that was intended to resemble the ocean was seen through this window. I found this project to be really appealing, and I could see that the designer had put a lot of work into it, so it was awesome to see.
