#### SASS Variables -
- Variables are a way to store information that we want to reuse throughout in our stylesheet.
- They allow us to store values for colors, fonts or really any CSS value that you want to reuse!
- We use the $ symbol when we wish to make something a variable.

```
$color-blue: #ffff00; // Blue

body {
  background-color: $color-blue;
}
```

#### Nesting - 
- Nesting is a way to organize your code and make it easier to read. It also helps keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Nesting is when you put one selector inside another selector. This is a great way to keep your code organized and make it easier to read.
 CSS Nesting example
 ```
 .navbar {
  background-color: orangered;
  padding: 1rem;
}
.navbar ul {
  list-style: none;
}
.navbar li {
  text-align: center;
  margin: 1rem;
}
```

Sass nesting, we can write much cleaner code.

```
.navbar {
  background-color: orangered;
  padding: 1rem;
  ul {
    list-style: none;
  }
  li {
    text-align: center;
    margin: 1rem;
  }
}
```
