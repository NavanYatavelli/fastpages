#### SASS Variables -
- Variables are a way to store information that we want to reuse throughout in our stylesheet.
- They allow us to store values for colors, fonts or really any CSS value that you want to reuse!
- We use the $ symbol when we wish to make something a variable.


#### Nesting - 
- Nesting is a way to organize your code and make it easier to read. It also helps keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Nesting is when you put one selector inside another selector. This is a great way to keep your code organized and make it easier to read.
