| 1   | NA        |
| 2   | NA        |
| 3   | (C) To make the simulation more accurate        |
| 4   | (C) Imperfections on aircraft        |
| 5   | (C) Situation considered        |
| 6   | (A) simulation        |
| 7   | (A) simulation       |
| 8   | NA        |
| 9   | (B) experiment/calculation |


#### Explanation 
3. The reason not to use a pseudo-random number generator when making a simulation is to make the simulation more accurate
4. The least likely factor to be removed from a flight(air traffic) simulation for functionality is due to imperfections on aircraft
5.  The difference between a experiment and a simulation is situation considered
6.  A car company needs to know how safe it's customers will be if it's new car crashes uses Simulation because it's too dangerous to have this be an experiment
7.  A environmental group wants an accurate guess on the impact the greenhouse effect will have on the environment would like to do simulation. Also, we don't want to experiment with this because it could cause great harm on the environment 
9.  A teacher want's to find the average score from a final using expirement because there is no need to simulate anything, this will only be a simple calculation of the average
