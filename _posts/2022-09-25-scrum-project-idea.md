# Program purpose

The website that our team decided to create is called `Striver`. The website keeps track of your personal goals and shares them with others. Just like popular social media websites such as Instagram and Facebook, you will be able to like each other's goals and see a the goals of people that you know.

# Design

Our group decided to use Google Drawings to mock up what our website will look like. We have decided to use Bootstrap in order to design the components. We will use Flask to template different pages. The like button is going to be an image that, when clicked, will switch to an undecided color.

# SCRUM team role

My team and I decided on the following roles:

- Navan: DevOps
- Safin: SCRUM Master
- Kalani: Frontend
- Alex: Backend


As DevOps Lead , I'm the liaison between the other team members that contribute to software maintenance and creation with the purpose of making faster updates and writing code that is easy to update and access.The DevOps pipeline will be powered by GitHub Actions + some hosting provider (presumably AWS) . We intend to use HTML/CSS/JS for our frontend and Python on the backend.
