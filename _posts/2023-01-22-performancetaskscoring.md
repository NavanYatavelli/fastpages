# Submission 1

| Reporting Category | Student Score | CB Score | Comments |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The video includes input, program functionality, and output. The student correctly identifies the program's purpose, function, and the inputs they used. |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Second code segemnt DOES NOT show the data being accessed frm the list RPS. |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | List DOES NOT manage complexity. An if statement could have just been used. USer doesn't explain the neccessity of the list correctly.|
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Missing: how the procedure contributes to the overall program. Student is too vague.| 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Student algorithm, rpsGame has squencing, selection, and iteration. Student explains the algorithm in enough detil to recreate.| 
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Procedure is called twice, wach time with different parameters. Describes both calls.| 

# Submission  2

| Reporting Category | Student Score | CBd Score | Comments |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The student met the requirement because in their video they showed entering the input (with their mouse drawing), the program is run, and the output is displayed (the pixels moving around). In their response, they clearly state the functionality (how their program works, and the purpose (mimic Game of Life) and lists the inputs and outputs of the function. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Student shows the data being stored in a list, it being accessed, and is able to identify the list’s name |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | Acurrately explains why the list is necessary and how it manages complexity |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student has a procedure which used two parameters. Accurately describes the program’s functionality. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The code uses sequencing, an if statement, and a repeat loop. They explain the process in detail. | 
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Describes two calls with different parameters and shows the output of both. |

| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The video includes input, program functionality, and output. The student correctly identifies the program's purpose, function, and the inputs they used. |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Second code segemnt DOES NOT show the data being accessed frm the list. |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | User doesn't explain the neccessity of the list correctly. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Missing: parameter. Student is too vaguewhen describing the functionality | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | No iteration used in procedure updateScreen | 
| Testing | 0 | 0 | Does not descirbe calls to teh procedure or have a parameter. Describes the operation being preformed instead of the condition being tested by the parameter |

| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The video includes input, program functionality, and output. The student correctly identifies the program's purpose, function, and the inputs they used. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Two segments that meet the standards, correctly identifies list as fishtypes |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | Code does manage complexity, and explains well why it is needed |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | clone+movement+range is a procedure that uses parameters. Decribes in detail the functionality. | 
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Has sequencing, selection, and iteration. Explains in enough detail to recreate| 
| Testing | 0 | 0 | Does not descirbe calls to the procedure or have a parameter. Does not decribe the conditions being tested |
