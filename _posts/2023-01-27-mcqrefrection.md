(2)For this question, we need to pick two answers.  I picked the first D and A. After evaluating again the the loop with missing condition for random function it is very clear C is the other answer. The option B is not correct since it does not satisfy the expected condition.

 (3) In this question, again there are two correct answers. In A the loop repeates 4 times of move forward, left, forward, right to reach the gray area. Also D has two inner loops of move forward, forward, left and againg has similar loop that reaches target. The options B and C does not few extra moves that will not reach the gray box, hence these are incorrect.
