Answer: 17 looking at the code segmant its all the right values
Answer: num1 = 6, num2 = 11

Test 1

firstName <- "Bob" lastName <- "Smith" var <- substring(firstName, 1, 1) name <- concat(lastName, var) email <- concat(name, "@gmail.com") DISPLAY(email)

What would the result be?

Hint: var = "B" name = "SmithB"

Asnwer: Result would be "SmithB@gmail.com" for email based on the sequencing

Test 2
word1 <- "computer" word2 <- "textbooks" length1 <- len(word1)/2 length2 <- len(word2)/3 first <- substring(word1, 2, len1) second <- substring(word2, len2+3, len2) newWord <- concat(first, second) DISPLAY(newWord)

Answer: since the length of "computer" is 8 then you divide it by two to get 4. Then for word2 it is 9/3 which is 3. This means it is the first 4 of "computer" besides 'c' and last 3 of "textbook" so the answer is "ompuook" for the result
