    <h2 id="our-project-striver">Our Project Striver</h2>
<p>We created Striver, a program that acts as a social media website for thoughts and quotes. The api we created randomly generated an inspirational quote that once could like and comment on. As you can see from the image, any user can add own post to their “forum”.</p>

<p>I concluded night at the museum by watching a talk, where he talked about Food Waste. He had many very interesting facts about the harm that Food Waste is bringing on our world, and made a very lasting impact on his listener to prevent themselves from wasting food and water.</p>

<h4 id="summary---night-at-the-museum">Summary - Night At The Museum</h4>
<p>I had a very good time at Night At The Museum as I got to see all my friends and compare the projects that we have been working on all trimester. Seeing all the different classes and perspectives of art was very fun, and I overall had a very good time at my first night at the museum!!!</p>
