<p>I discovered through this grading exercise that there are some differences between my scoring and the AP record. I understood that the written response needed to include all of the rubric’s components. I lose the entire point even if I only miss one sentence in the written portion. So I have to be careful to incorporate all of the rubric’s requirements within the written response. I also need lists, an algorithm, and clear explanations of my code in my written response in order to fully satisfy all requirements. Finally, I discovered that it’s very simple to lose points if not all of a section’s requirements are met; some students had met all but one requirement and still lost a point.</p>
